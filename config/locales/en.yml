# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    prepregnant: For women who are planning to have a baby, the three most important things to focus on are healthy ovulation, hormonal health, and stress reduction. Additionally, it is crucial to reduce the amount of body toxins by reducing oneâ€™s consumption of fast foods, oily foods, and fried foods. <br /> <br />In this phase, we recommend foods that will help reduce your cortisol levels (stress hormones), fertility boosting foods, and foods with vitamins and nutrients for healthy pregnancy.
